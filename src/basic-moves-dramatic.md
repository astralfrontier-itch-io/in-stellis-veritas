# Basic Moves: Dramatic

## Kirk Summation

When you **articulate your values**, either give an actual speech or just say what you want to convey and roll+Division. On a hit, your words are persuasive and enemies and/or allies takes what you have to say to heart. On a 7-9, it costs you; the GM declares a sacrifice, compromise, or loss you must endure for your speech to be effective.

> This move can be an impassioned speech, a commentary on the human condition, a demonstration of your integrity in the face of troubling orders, or anything else where your moral fiber and determination are being tested by authority or danger. It does not let you talk your way out of being surrounded by armed guards with phasers, but could (for example) improve your situation with their leader.

## “My species”/”We humans”

**When you say what your species or kind is like or can do**, detail a feature of your physiology, culture, or history that is now true in the fiction. If you field a question from another character, or accept elaboration from another player about what you said, either you or them (your choice) take +1 forward in a situation where this revelation is relevant.

## Make It So

When you **make a command decision**, declare the circumstances you’re trying to change (e.g. being surrounded by enemy ships) and at least some idea of how you’d get out of it (through technology, trickery, prior arrangements, or a surprising revelation). Roll+Command. On a hit, the status quo shifts in your favor. On a 7-9, this shift comes at a cost; the GM will say what. On a miss, things still change, but not for the better.

> This move is pretty vague and that’s intentional. It’s intended to give that “playing Poker with the enemy” vibe, where you can pull out a surprise like “I have cloaked Klingon ships nearby” or “I planted a bomb on the warp core”. Note that everyone can make a command decision - you don’t have to technically be in charge.

## Fascinating

When you **study a situation or phenomenon**, roll+Science. On a hit, describe a detail that becomes true about the situation. You or anyone you advise takes +1 forward to act on this information. On a 7-9, the GM will also describe a detail, which can’t contradict yours but can complicate it.

> Most of the time, “I analyze the thing and tell the captain about it” can be kind of boring. The intention here is for people who want to play Science types to get creative with the world.

## Warp Speed Now!

When you **employ technological solutions**, roll+Engineering. On a hit, your solution is appropriate to the problem. Pick two from the following list. On a 10+, pick one.

- The solution will leave the team or ship vulnerable in some way
- The solution will complicate the situation in some other way
- Enacting the solution will leave no time to try alternatives
- The solution comes at a personal cost

## Fire Phasers!

When you **confront a danger through force**, roll+Security. On a hit, pick one from the following list. On a 7-9, the danger is realized in some way and you or someone you’re protecting suffers from it.

- The danger can be contained or confined to an area
- You pick allies that cannot be harmed by the danger any further
- The danger is diminished or altered
- Either you or the danger leave the scene (GM’s choice but the GM must tell you before you commit to this option)

## We Come In Peace

When you **interact with others in a tense situation**, roll+Diplomacy. On a hit, you learn something that will defuse the tension or turn the situation to your advantage; anyone who acts on this information will benefit. On a 7-9, you either reveal something you’d rather not, or must make a concession (your choice).

## That’s An Order

When you **engage with your chain of command on a difficult subject**, roll+Standing. On a hit, your order or request is accepted. On a 7-9, it takes some jockeying, bargaining, or favor to achieve your end; the GM will tell you what you must do. On a miss, your actions draw scrutiny and sanction from the higher-ups.
