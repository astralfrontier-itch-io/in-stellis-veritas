# Scenarios

The GM can devise their own stories, or draw on these standard tropes. The goal when creating a scenario is not to write an ending and steer the characters toward it, but rather to settle on an overarching theme and keep guiding the situation in ways that explore or develop that theme. If you’re telling a story about revenge, the presence of a space anomaly shouldn’t turn the scenario into a mystery. Instead, the anomaly should somehow serve the purpose of the revenge story (e.g. a rogue commander sent a hated subordinate into the anomaly, knowing they would be killed).

That said, the players will not always resonate with a given story. This is why the GM should solicit and encourage player input, or incorporate earlier player feedback, during the development process. Running a satisfying game is more important than springing a surprise.

The GM should ask themselves these questions when setting up a scenario:

- Is the ship and crew much more powerful than the people they’ll interact with, much less, or on equal footing?
    - If more powerful, one challenge will be to use discretion and persuasion rather than force.
    - If less powerful, the crew must find ways to survive and perhaps fight back without being overwhelmed.
- For each of the divisions, what limits or complications have been imposed on the crew by the situation? Not every division will be relevant, but the GM should include at least two.
    - Command - the ship or crew are under some kind of restrictive orders to do (or not do) something, which will make things difficult or annoying. The situation will demand hard choices and encourage compromises.
    - Science - some parts of the situation are unknown, and unanswered questions will complicate the situation. What the characters thought they knew about the relevant sciences are upended or reversed.
    - Engineering - there are technical challenges or limits, such as a time limit on life support or propulsion, that will impact the crew. The tech the crew depends on turns on them or will fail at inopportune moments.
    - Security - there is a source of danger or the presence of hostile forces which the crew must work around or confront. Someone perceives danger where there is none, or is ignorant of a real danger and must be warned or persuaded.
    - Diplomacy - another culture’s rules are in operation and must be respected, to avoid a large-scale incident. One or more individuals are uncooperative or distant, and must be reached through careful interactions.

Before playing through the scenario, the GM should also invite players to swap characters, or create Guest characters, if they feel their main character would be out of place or unhelpful in the scenario. Guest characters can be friendly or adversarial.

## **Technology encroaches on humanity**

This can mean thinking machines, artificial life forms, cloning, or any other scientific advance that threatens the dignity and self-determination of humanity. The crew must address the ways this technology can help or hurt people, while also acknowledging the original problems the technology was developed to address.

A notable sub-category here is synthetic life and artificial intelligence. Is it inherently dangerous or destabilizing? Is it difficult to achieve? To what extent is simulated life and consciousness real vs. illusion?

## **A clash of values**

A liminal space emerges where two dissimilar peoples must interact. Uncertainty or imbalance gives rise to conflict. The crew must find solutions to the problems posed by this clash, without also drawing more people into it.

## Into the unknown

A strange phenomenon - alien technology, an unexplained form of energy, a disease, etc. - is altering life for people, and the crew must assist. This phenomenon can pose as much danger to the mind, will, and spirit as it does to the body or to a starship.

## **Idols and mirrors**

The crew encounter a powerful being whose presence or actions threaten them or something they must protect. A character meets an old friend, a superior officer, a mentor, or some other figure they respect. A planet or colony ship has a population of humans or human-like beings with a startling resemblance to Earth.

In any case, the crew must reckon with what these things say about the human condition, and either escape unharmed or perform some helpful service to those in need.

## Example scenario creation

- “Silicon Avatar” (TNG) - the Crystalline Entity attacks a colony and Dr. Kila Marr assists the Enterprise in dealing with it. This scenario could be classed as “a clash of values” - both the Entity’s vs. the Federation, and Dr. Marr’s revenge motive vs. the Enterprise crew’s desire for peace. The relevant Divisions for this scenario are Security (the danger posed by the Entity) and Diplomacy (the drive to communicate).
- “Cause and Effect” (TNG) - a space anomaly traps the Enterprise in a time loop. Data is key to carrying a message forward into the next loop, but what message will be enough? This scenario is “into the unknown”, with Command and Science driving the scenario.
- “The Measure of a Man” (TNG) - Data is put on trial to establish his personhood and subsequent rights, against Captain Louvois and Commander Maddox as antagonists. The scenario is “idols and mirrors”, with Command (Riker is forced to act as prosecutor) and Diplomacy as driving forces.
