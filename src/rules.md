# Rules

- To make a check, roll 2d6 + your value in the appropriate Division. If a rule says to use a specific Division, use that one. Otherwise, use the Division in which you’re currently acting (your discretion).
- A 7+ on a check is a hit, a 10+ is a strong hit, and 6 or less is a miss.
- Rules can give +1 forward (a bonus to the next check) or +1 ongoing (a bonus to all subsequent checks).
- On any miss, mark 1 Progress.
- When you reach 5 Progress, mark off an Upgrade from your Profile and reset your Progress to 0.
- You cannot Upgrade more than 2 steps past the rest of the party. If you would otherwise do so, choose another character to receive the Upgrade instead.

> The intent of this is not only to keep everyone roughly at the same advancement level, but also to emphasize the shared risks and rewards of being part of a crew. For example, Boimler has 1 Upgrade, Mariner has 2. Mariner can mark a third Upgrade, but if she would mark a 4th, she has to grant that Upgrade to someone else.
> 
- Some rules allow you to shift your Division values. This means +1 to one value (maximum +2) and -1 to another one (minimum -2). This change is permanent, but future shifts can alter or undo it. You can only raise Division values to +3 if you’ve taken an Upgrade that allows you to do so.

## Upgrades

Anyone can mark these Upgrades, in addition to any Upgrades provided by their Profile:

- Take another move from your Profile, available unlimited times
- Take a move from another Profile, available twice
- Take a move from the Profile of someone you share a Dynamic with, available once per Dynamic partner
- Add +1 to a Division (limit +2), available twice
- Add +1 to Standing (limit +3), available unlimited times

## Conditions

On a failed move, or under appropriate circumstances, the GM can assign one or more of these Conditions to a PC. Conditions are cleared when another character works to mitigate the Condition on the PC’s behalf (through medical aid, counseling, conversation, etc.), or at the end of a session. Each Condition also comes with a way to clear it.

A suggested list of Conditions;

- **Conflicted**. You’re facing a crisis of conscience or moral dilemma. You aren’t sure what is the right thing to do - or what is right isn’t what’s necessary or expedient. Clear this condition when you firmly commit to one of the alternatives, and pay a dramatic price for doing so.
- **Dominated**. Alien influence, psychic powers, cosmic phenomena, and many other things can affect the human body and mind. The GM should inform the player of the nature of the domination and then only advise the player on what’s appropriate, rather than taking control of the character. Clear this condition when you pass on the domination to someone else, or overcome the source of the domination.
- **Hurt**. You’re physically impaired and struggle to complete anything beyond basic tasks or self-care. This could be due to a wound, illness, or exposure to hostile atmospheres or lifeforms. Clear this condition when you spend a scene undergoing medical care aboard a starship or in equivalent facilities.
