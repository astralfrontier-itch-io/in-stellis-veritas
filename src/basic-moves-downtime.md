# Basic Moves: Downtime

When you **shadow a senior officer or engage in training during downtime**, you can shift one Division up and another down. For example, if you’re undergoing Command training or working under a captain or first officer, you can raise Command by 1 and lower another Division by 1.

When you **acknowledge a shift in relationships**, you can add a new Dynamic, remove an old Dynamic, or replace one Dynamic with another.

When **you take responsibility for a mistake**, reduce Standing by 1 (to a minimum of -2) and swap one of your moves with any other move you’re eligible to take.
