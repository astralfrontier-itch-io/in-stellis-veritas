# Character Creation

- Pick a **Profile** - the reason you’re in space, doing what you’re doing, and how you do it. Select moves as directed by your Profile.
- Distribute +2, +1, +1, +0, -1 between these **Divisions**: Command, Science, Engineering, Security, Diplomacy
- Assign a +0 to an additional attribute, called Standing. This attribute represents your position in both the unofficial and official hierarchy of your ship and your organization. A well respected Lieutenant can have higher Standing than an unpopular Captain.
- Establish a **Dynamic** with one or two other characters (with their players’ consent), such that every character in the group is a member of one and only one Dynamic. While Dynamics are usually written for two people, adjustments can be made to accommodate three.
